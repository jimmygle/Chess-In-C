# Chess-In-C
This is a Chess game written in C. It uses standard [Chess notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation) for entering moves. It currently only has both players' pieces represented, and can move them freely. There's no piece specific logic or collision detection yet.

**Note:** This code is a mess. It's strictly a learning exercise and I am continuing to iterate on it as I learn the language.

# Run It

* `make`
* `./chess`

# To Do

* Add automated testing capabilities
* Add logic that ensures movement is valid for each respective piece
* Add collision detection and capturing of opponent pieces
* Add logic for check and checkmate

# Ideas

* Rudimentary visual representation of the board that's not simply Chess notation in a table
* Basic AI (to experiment with algorithm development)
* Basic multiplayer (to experiment with low level network programming)
